42 Days until Presidential Election
Hi again! Since last week, the Harris and Trump campaigns have been
campaigning aggressively in battleground states. Realistically, who the
next president will be hinges on voters in these key states: some have
called this 
  the closest presidential race of the past six
decades.
I touched briefly on the Harris-Trump debate last week, and although the
Harris campaign agreed to another, Trump refuses to debate 
  while voters
in some states are beginning to cast their
ballots.
The VP candidates, however, are scheduled to debate each other next week
on 
  October
1st.
This week, early voting begins in 
  Minnesota, South Dakota, and
Virginia.
Considering how thin the margins between Harris and Trump are, it is
important to consistently track their performance through polling data.
Involving polling data into my model is the focus of this week. Because
this race is unique in the fact that Harris entered with less than 16
weeks until election day, the scope of our forecasting is much more
limited in available polling data than previous election years.">

<strong>42 Days until Presidential Election</strong></p>
<p><em>Hi again! Since last week, the Harris and Trump campaigns have been
campaigning aggressively in battleground states. Realistically, who the
next president will be hinges on voters in these key states: some have
called this 
  <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/22/politics/closest-presidential-race-harris-trump/index.html">the closest presidential race of the past six
decades</a>.
I touched briefly on the Harris-Trump debate last week, and although the
Harris campaign agreed to another, Trump refuses to debate 
  <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/21/politics/presidential-debate-harris-trump-cnn/index.html">while voters
in some states are beginning to cast their
ballots</a>.
The VP candidates, however, are scheduled to debate each other next week
on 
  <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/when-where-is-vance-walz-us-vice-presidential-debate-2024-09-19/">October
1st</a>.
This week, early voting begins in 
  <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/early-in-person-voting-begins-in-three-states-kicking-off-the-sprint-to-election-day">Minnesota, South Dakota, and
Virginia</a>.
Considering how thin the margins between Harris and Trump are, it is
important to consistently track their performance through polling data.
Involving polling data into my model is the focus of this week. Because
this race is unique in the fact that Harris entered with less than 16
weeks until election day, the scope of our forecasting is much more
limited in available polling data than previous election years.</em></p>

<p>In the charts above, I visualize the distribution of ratings of
individual polls I use for the 2016, 2020, and 2024 election years. This
data was provided by Matthew Dardet, who initially sourced it from

  <a href="https://github.com/fivethirtyeight"><em>FiveThirtyEight</em>&rsquo;s public GitHub</a>.
<em>FiveThirtyEight</em>, a poll aggregator, assigns grade values to individual
polls, which we can use a proxy to interpret how much trust to put into
their numbers. You might notice that the scale evolves from an A-D
grading scaling, to A-F with &ldquo;on-the-fence&rdquo; assignments as well (e.g.
&ldquo;A/B&rdquo;), to a continuous numeric scale from 0-3.0. For the sake of
comparison, I&rsquo;ve stacked these plots to understand how the distribution
of polling quality varies from election year to election year. It seems
that there exists—as a whole—a pretty even spread of poll ratings, with
convergence on A, B, C grades (or 3, 2, 1 grades). In 2020, however,
there seem to be significantly more polls with a C rating. There are
also a good amount of polls that have not been assigned grades (NA
values). In its forecasting, <em>FiveThirtyEight</em> weights poll data by its
rating, so as not to give the same importance to the numbers of a
fail-grade poll as an exceptional one.</p>
<h2 id="2016-polling-averages">
  2016 Polling Averages
  <a class="anchor" href="#2016-polling-averages">#</a>

<img src="https://sduggasani.github.io/2024election-blog/post/2024-09-23-week-3-polling/index_files/figure-html/2016-1.png" width="672" />
<p>To set up this plot, I averaged individual polls across the same day for
the year leading up to the 2016 election. The polling numbers are
interesting here because for the first few months it appears that, as
Clinton went up in approval, so did Trump—same with when her numbers
fell. This is not intuitive because, one would assume, that when a
Democratic candidate does well a Republican candidate&rsquo;s approval drops
(and vice versa). It is important to note, however, this is before both
parties&rsquo; primaries even began. After February 1, 2016 when primaries
began, Clinton&rsquo;s gains coincide with Trump&rsquo;s losses and Trump&rsquo;s gains
with Clinton&rsquo;s losses. I hypothesize that this is because a frontrunner
emerges within each party and voters begin to seriously compare top
candidates across parties, resulting in inverse effects between them.
The Clinton-Trump polling margin ranged from over 10 points to less than
one 1 point. Clinton seemed to maintain the lead throughout the race
however, which is in line with her eventually winning the popular vote
in November. The dashed line represents each candidate&rsquo;s actual vote
share in the election; as a whole, these polls underestimated the
popular vote share of both candidates.</p>

<p>I set up this plot the same way I did for 2016, by taking day averages.
The party primaries in 2020 began on February 3rd. We see the same
phenomenon we did in 2016, where before that point the approval of both
candidates seems to line up with the same ups and downs. After February
3rd, however, the main candidates emerge and begin to diverge: when
Trump did well, Biden did poorly and when Biden did well, Trump did
poorly. Especially in comparison to 2016, the final polls were
remarkably close to predicting the actual vote share of each candidate.
For Biden, it is virtually the same, and for Trump, just a point or two
short.</p>
<h2 id="2024-polling-averages">

  <a class="anchor" href="#2024-polling-averages">#</a>

<p>For this plot, I calculated and plotted day averages just like I did for
2016 and 2024. You might notice that you see much less polling data for
Harris (blue dots) until about July. This is because Biden was the
assumed Democratic candidate who would face off against Trump for the
majority of the election cycle. The polls that collected data on Harris
were likely operating under a hypothetical and testing how various
alternates would fare against Trump. After Biden dropped out and that
became a reality, more polling data on Harris as president was
collected.</p>

<p>The above charts are bit technical, but their purpose is to visualize
the regularization of my regression that uses individual polls from 2016
and 2020 to predict the outcome of the 2024 election. I essentially
train a model on polling data from 2016 and 2020, subsetting to the
period of 16 weeks to 7 weeks out from election day because accurate
polls for Harris&rsquo;s campaign are only available for this time. I, then,
test on the Harris-Trump polling data in this period and predict the
outcome. I rely on an elastic net model that would minimize
multi-collinearity and increase robustness. Though LASSO and Ridge
regression are also useful models, the elastic net is versatile and
flexibile because it incorporates both of those methods as well. It is
also much preferable to Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) because OLS is
susceptible to overfitting and collinearity.</p>
<p>Based on the visualization, we see that 14 weeks from election day (the
week after Harris announced her campaign), 11 weeks from election day
(during the DNC), and 8 weeks from election day (during the presidential
debate where Harris performed well) the model demonstrates relatively
higher coefficients—though a marginal difference as compared to other
weeks. My model based on individual polls predicts Harris&rsquo;s popular vote
share at about 47.96% and Trump&rsquo;s at 47.32%, corroborating predicitions
of an incredibly close election. This is a much closer margin than what
Dardet predicted with national poll averages from 1968-2024, which had
Harris at 51.8% and Trump at 50.7%. We will address later how it is
possible that both candidates&rsquo; vote shares add up to more than 100%.</p>

<p>After using 2016 and 2020 individual polls to predict the 2024 popular
vote outcome, I decided I also wanted involve a fundamentals model (See:
Week 2 Post for more details) and consider models that weight data
heavier for weeks closer to election day. There are five new models,
which I construct.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A Fundamentals Only Model using Elastic Net</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Combined Fundamentals and Polling Data Model using Elastic Net</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An Unweighted Polling Data and Fundamentals Model</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An Closer-To-November-Increasing Weight Polling Data Model
(attributable to Nate Silver)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An Closer-To-November-Increasing Weight Fundamentals Model
(attributable to Gelman &amp; King, 1993)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Because elastic net predicts linearly and without constraints, I
initially had predictions saying that Harris and Trump would get popular
vote shares above 60% each. This does not make sense, so I regularized
the scales and recalculated such that Harris and Trump were compared
against each other and their sums would be 100% to be more informative
of how they would actually fare in the election. This would be similar
to a two-party vote share. The first two models show that Harris and
Trump will tie at 50% vote shares. Once we move to the third Unweighted
Polling Data and Fundamentals Model, we find that Harris is predicted to
win the two-party popular vote by about .3 points. Mimicing Silver&rsquo;s
model, which assigns higher weights to polls as we move closer to
election day, I find that Harris is predicted to win the two-party
popular vote by about .6 points. The margins for a Harris win are much
slimmer using Gelman &amp; King&rsquo;s model, which weights fundamentals higher
closer to the election at .1.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">
  <strong>Conclusion</strong>
  <a class="anchor" href="#conclusion">#</a>
</h2>
<p><strong>Prediction: Based on my individual polls-generated models, Harris will
win the popular vote in November by a razor-thin margin.</strong></p>
<p>Across all models I constructed using individual polls from 2016, 2020,
and 2024, Harris is predicted to win the popular vote. The models all
vary by how much she is predicted to win, but they all find that she
will win by an incredibly thin margin. This corroborates the
characterization of this race as the closest in decades.</p>
